# Learning python - Introduction to programming with sample codes

## Welcome!
Here you will find a collection of codes that will help improve your pythonic knowledge. The main idea of this GitHub page is to create a community open source library of simple python codes. These codes are going to be arranged in different categories, and will touch on different python subjects, so no matter if you are a beginner or an master of python, you will hopefully fin an interesting code. Lastly, everyone is welcomed to send me their code, if they want it to be posted here, I will make sure to properly cite the author.


#The poker game!
Poker is an interesting game, and it is even more interesting to code it! You can find sample codes on this subject on the "Poker" folder. To make it easier for python padawans to have a better understanding of code logic, there are three main versions of the "Checking poker hands", which is the core of a poker game: the simplified, using functions, and using classes. Feel free to check each one individually, or jump right into a mini poker game, where more advanced structure and logic is used.
