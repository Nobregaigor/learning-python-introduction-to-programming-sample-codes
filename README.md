These codes are going to be arranged in different categories, and will touch on different python subjects, so no matter if you are a beginner or an master of python, you will hopefully fin an interesting code. Lastly, everyone is welcomed to send me their code, if they want it to be posted here, I will make sure to properly cite the author.
